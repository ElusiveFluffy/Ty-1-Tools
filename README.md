# Requires [<ins>TygerFramework</ins>](https://github.com/ElusiveFluffy/TygerFramework/releases) v1.1.0 or higher

This is a general utility mod, currently only for Ty 1, but potentially Ty 2 and maybe 3 too later on. 

Thanks to buzchy for letting me base some of the stuff in this off of his Ty 1 trainer, and thanks to Matt for finding some of the memory addresses that I used in this.
# Features
- Set Ty's movement stats (In game leaderboards have been disabled to avoid easy cheating)
- Set and unset Ty's obtained rangs
- Saving Ty/Bull's position, rotation, state, and camera position to 10 slots, each level has their own separate 10 slots ('[' and ']' to cycle through the slots and 'shift+F4' to save, and 'F4' to load. Can also press the 'home' key to return back to the spawn of the level).
These positions are also saved to a file in the plugins folder with the file name "Tyger Utility Saved Positions.TyPos"
- Easily enable the free cam, and option to lock Ty's position while its enabled, and set its speed
- Set the amount of charge bites Ty has
- Set Ty invincibility
- Debug overlay with a bunch of different stats with Ty and Bull, including: position, rotation, speed, current animation name, ground ID, and Ty/Bull state, and camera state.
- There is also a option to enable the level select without inputting the cheat code, and saves the option's state when closing the game

To access the menu for all of the setting just open the TygerFramework menus with F1
